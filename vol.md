A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly a
brand-new BMW advanced out of the dust cloud towards him. The driver, a
young man in a Broni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie,
leaned out the window and asked the shepherd... "If I tell you exactly how
many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?" The shepherd
looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at his peacefully
grazing flock and calmly answered "sure".
The yuppie parked his car, whipped out his IBM ThinkPad and connected it
to a cell phone, then he surfed to a NASA page on the internet where he
called up a GPS satellite navigation system, scanned the area, and then
opened up a database and an Excel spreadsheet with complex formulas. He
sent an email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, received a
response. Finally, he prints out a 130-page report on his miniaturized
printer then turns to the shepherd and says, "You have exactly 1586 sheep.
"That is correct; take one of the sheep." said the shepherd. He watches
the young man select one of the animals and bundle it into his car.
Then the shepherd says: "If I can tell you exactly what your business is,
will you give me back my animal?", "OK, why not." answered the young man.
"Clearly, you are a consultant." said the shepherd. "That's correct." says
the yuppie, "but how did you guess that?" "No guessing required." answers
the shepherd. "You turned up here although nobody called you. You want to
get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked, and
you don't know crap about my business...... Now give me back my dog.”

This is a communal kitchen, this means that there is one single table where about 10-12 people share a 10 course dinner.


It was a great atmosphere dining right next to where the food was being prepared and cooked and we enjoyed sharing a communal table giving us the chance to meet others visiting Beijing.


Bottom line: come here knowing you'll splurge, then sit back to enjoy a fine dining experience.

Do I need thinning scissors?
Yes. Although you won't use thinning scissors on every haircut they're a vital part of your tool kit.


A repetitive strain injury (RSI) is an "injury to the musculoskeletal and nervous systems that may be caused by repetitive tasks, forceful exertions, vibrations, mechanical compression, or sustained or awkward positions".


Your scissors should always feel comfortable in your hand that way you'll minimise hand fatigue and the chance of developing RSI or carpal tunnel syndrome.


Absurd comment. Instead of condemning violence you're saying "be respectful". So if someone isn't respectful, you think hacking them to death is acceptable? Which is worse?﻿

Some people still have the mentality of the dark ages. It's 2016 people. An honorable man would have paid his bill and an honorable man would not have killed someone over a bill.

Surprise the employee didn't kick u out for filming. If I filmed at my local Starbucks here in Murica. An employee would tell me to get out if I started filming or take selfies. Sometimes security guard or police officer would pull out their pepper spray or baton. Threaten me to get out. Overall, great video.﻿

Impeding the flow of traffic will get you not only road rage but a ticket. Either pick up the pace or stay home. Your kind are actually more dangerous than speeders.


I sometimes back in. for some reason all my family's cars and neighbors have been backing into each other. it is easy-er to back in, and just drive out when ya leave. have you ever been to Costco trying to back out and a big a** lifted truck is in your view? imagine if you just backed in.


I would say, manouvering-wise it is easier to drive in and back out, but that you are supposed to be taught how to back in before the driving test, so you can drive out and back in, which is safer assuming you can do it.


One reason _not_ to is at a supermarket - the boot [trunk] is at the rear, and easier to put shopping into if you don't have to squeeze past the car.
